Scents of Hope is a candle business started by my grandma. 25% of every sale gets donated to help prevent sex trafficking for little girls in Cambodia. As of right now the site this code is on is https://sohwebsite-d3695.web.app/ but will be changing to https://www.scentsofhope.net/ in the future after we get the correct logo for the main page and get everything moved over.
