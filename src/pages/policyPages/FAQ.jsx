            <strong><p>Why is soy wax better than paraffin?</p></strong>

            <p>I use 100% soy wax which is a natural product made from soybeans. USA grown soybeans! There are no additives included. Paraffin wax is the byproduct from the refining of lubricating oil. My soy wax burns slow and clean. There should be no smoking if the wick is kept trimmed. Sidenote: my wicks are made from 100% braided cotton. There is no wire center. If you value clean air in your home, soy is the only way to go!</p>

            <strong><p>How do I get the best burn with a soy candle?</p></strong>

            <p>Always start with a wick no longer than 1/4 inch. The first light is important to establish a complete wax pool. That means the wax melts all the way to all sides of the jar. By doing that on the first burn, all the future burns will be the same. There will be no tunneling.</p> 
            
            <p> Always give a fresh cut to your wick for each new burn. For safety reasons always follow the directions on the bottom of your candle.</p>
